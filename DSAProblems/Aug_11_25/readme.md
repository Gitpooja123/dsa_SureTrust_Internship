# Real-World Use Case of Thread Synchronization

Thread synchronization is used when **multiple threads work on the same shared resource** such as a database, file, API call, or memory object.  
It ensures that only one thread can access the resource at a time, preventing data inconsistency and race conditions.

## Examples

### 1. Banking System
When two users try to **withdraw or transfer money** from the same account at the same time, synchronization ensures:
- The balance is updated correctly.
- No double withdrawal occurs.

Without synchronization, both withdrawals might be approved based on an outdated balance, leading to incorrect results.

### 2. E-Commerce Inventory
If only **one product is left** in stock and two users click "Buy Now" at the same time:
- Synchronization ensures only one purchase goes through.
- The second user receives an "Out of Stock" message.

---

### 3. File Writing
When two threads write to the **same file** simultaneously:
- Without synchronization, the file content can become corrupted.
- Synchronization ensures orderly and consistent writes.

---

### 4. Real-Time Sensor Data
If multiple threads update the **same sensor data object**:
- Synchronization ensures that readings remain consistent.
- Prevents overlapping updates that could cause inaccurate readings.

## Why Synchronization Matters
Synchronization:
- Prevents **race conditions**.
- Ensures **thread safety**.
- Maintains **data integrity** in multi-threaded applications.
