# Properties of Graph

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of a set of **vertices (nodes)** and a set of **edges (connections)**.  
Graphs are widely used to represent real-world problems such as social networks, road maps, and communication systems.

---

## 1. Vertices (Nodes)
- Fundamental units of a graph.
- **Example:** In a social network, each person is a vertex.

---

## 2. Edges
- Connections between two vertices.
- Can be **directed** (one-way, like Instagram follow) or **undirected** (two-way, like Facebook friendship).

---

## 3. Degree of a Vertex
- Number of edges connected to a vertex.
- **Indegree →** number of incoming edges (directed graph).
- **Outdegree →** number of outgoing edges (directed graph).
- **Example:** On Twitter, indegree = followers, outdegree = following.

---

## 4. Path
- A sequence of vertices connected by edges.
- **Example:** In Google Maps, a path is the route between two locations.

---

## 5. Cycle
- A path where the start and end vertices are the same.
- **Example:** In a road map, if you start at a city and come back without repeating edges.

---

## 6. Connectedness
- **Connected Graph →** every vertex can be reached from any other.
- **Disconnected Graph →** some vertices are isolated.

---

## 7. Weighted vs. Unweighted
- **Weighted Graph →** edges have a cost/weight (like distance, time, money).
- **Unweighted Graph →** all edges are equal.

---

## 8. Directed vs. Undirected
- **Directed Graph (Digraph) →** edges have direction (A → B).
- **Undirected Graph →** edges have no direction (A—B).

---

## 9. Subgraph
- A smaller graph formed from a subset of vertices and edges of the main graph.

---

## 10. Density
- Tells how many edges are present compared to the maximum possible edges.
- **Sparse Graph →** few edges.
- **Dense Graph →** many edges.

---

## 11. Adjacency
- Two vertices are **adjacent** if they are connected directly by an edge.

---

## 12. Special Graph Properties
- **Tree →** A connected graph with no cycles.
- **Bipartite Graph →** Vertices can be divided into two sets, and edges only connect vertices of different sets.
